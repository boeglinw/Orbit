# Orbit3
Lorentz orbit code for tracking charged particles in fusion plasmas

The code was originally developed at PPPL in the 1980's. It has been updated and can be compiled using gfortran.
All input is now controlled via namelists. Plotting software calls have been removed as plotting is handled externally via Python.
The python directory contains python scripts to steer the code and  plotting its results using python and matplotlib.

Not all necessary python modules are there for the scripts to work. If you need those please contact W.Boeglin
