# Orbit3
Lorentz orbit code for tracking charged particles in fusion plasmas

The code was originally developped at PPPL in the 1980's. It has been updated and can be compiled using gfortran.
All input is now controlled via namelists. Plotting software has been removed and is handled ecternally via Python.
