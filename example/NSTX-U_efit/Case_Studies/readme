Equilibria generate by ISOLVER, going out to R=1.85.


Profiles taken from:
geqshot         = 138239L
geqtime         = 0.595
geqindex        =  -4
q

All are high-kappa and high-delta equilibria. Q_min about 1.0 (different
choice of profiles would result in a different value of qmin)



Cases 2 and 4-7 have the same TF Rod current and Ip, but different outer gaps.

Case 1:
R0		= 0.95	; major radius of plasma geometric center
aminor		= 0.53	; plasma minor radius
Ip              = 1.0MA
BT              = 0.95 T

Case 2:
R0		= 0.95	; major radius of plasma geometric center
aminor		= 0.53	; plasma minor radius
Ip              = 1.5MA
BT              = 0.73 T

Case 3:
R0		= 0.95	; major radius of plasma geometric center
aminor		= 0.53	; plasma minor radius
Ip              = 2.0 MA
BT              = 1.0 T

Case 4:
R0		= 0.99	; major radius of plasma geometric center
aminor		= 0.53	; plasma minor radius

Case 5:
R0		= 0.91	; major radius of plasma geometric center
aminor		= 0.53	; plasma minor radius

Case 6:
R0		= 0.93	; major radius of plasma geometric center
aminor		= 0.53	; plasma minor radius

Case 7:
R0		= 0.97	; major radius of plasma geometric center
aminor		= 0.53	; plasma minor radius
